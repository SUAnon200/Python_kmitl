#Exercise 3: Write a function that takes the lengths of the two shorter 
#sides of a  righttriangle  as  its  parameters.  
#Return  the hypotenuseof  the  triangle, computed using Pythagorean 
#theorem, as the functionâ€™s result. Note that the lengths of the shorter 
#sides of a right triangle are read  as the user inputs, uses 
#your function to compute the length of the hypotenuse, and displays the result.
